I am not an expert gamer, but back in 2020, our family purchased a Playstation Pro. The wife and I spent two years playing Ghost Recon Breakpoint. We only played on the regular difficulty, but have mastered it.

Now since the Playstation 5 is so hard to find, we invested in an Microsoft XBOX SERIES X. It should arrive in a few days.
